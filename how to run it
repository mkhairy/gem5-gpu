Before you get started, ensure that you have any gcc >>4.7 (forcompiling the simulator) and gcc 4.4 (for compiling the workloads) installed on your machine 

1- create a new file at your home directory ( ./hgrc) and add the following to it

[extensions]
\mq=

[ui]
username = Mahmoud Khairy <abdallm@purdue.edu>

2- Download
download the simulator by following the steps in the next page:
https://gem5-gpu.cs.wisc.edu/wiki/start
download the benchmarks by following the steps in the next page:
https://gem5-gpu.cs.wisc.edu/wiki/benchmarks

3-
Run the attached git-diff script in at "download" directory
isnan.patch

4- Compile:
make gcc 4.7 as your defulat compier and build the gem-gpu by the following command
cd gem5
scons build/X86_VI_hammer_GPU/gem5.opt --default=X86 EXTRAS=../gem5-gpu/src:../gpgpu-sim/ PROTOCOL=VI_hammer GPGPU_SIM=True

5- use gcc 4.4 to compile workload
[gem5-gpu/benchmarks] cd rodinia/backprop
[gem5-gpu/benchmarks/rodinia/backprop] make gem5-fusion

6- run the workload by using the command
build/VI_hammer/gem5.opt ../gem5-gpu/configs/se_fusion.py -c ../benchmarks/rodinia/backprop/gem5_fusion_backprop -o "16"
