This unit test can be used to exercise GPU consistency bugs on a per-thread
basis. The GPU writes data to separate cache lines and CPU threads
continually read the results to see if it can find reorderings of the data
produced by the GPU. By compiling with different FENCE_TYPE flags, different
fences can be tested. The default contains no fences, so if a GPU LSQ/cache
hierarchy does not maintain store ordering, this default-compiled tester should
be able to show memory access races from GPU threads.
