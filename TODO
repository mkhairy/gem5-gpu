compling remaingin workloads
Jason email
ask:
DMA is Cope engine. TBE is MSHR
why DRAM data utilization is different
how many entris should be there

see why nocopy does  not work
under the config baseline with fusiona nd MI protcol
under the output (IPC, L1 cache hit rate, MSHRs)
config the baseline (memory shouldbe large), L1 cache should be large (read the paper), L3 cahce i
understand MI protcol
update the MI protocl for regsion
