compling remaingin workloads
Jason email
ask:
DMA is Cope engine. TBE is MSHR
why DRAM data utilization is different
how many entris should be there

see why nocopy does  not work
under the config baseline with fusion and MI protcol
under the output (IPC, L1 cache hit rate, MSHRs)
config the baseline (memory shouldbe large), L1 cache should be large (read the paper), L3 cahce i
understand MI protcol
update the MI protocl for regsion

increase memor BW (memchannels or dir)? 
can I increase the Bw with our increasing the dir
can i comment the codes, RubyMemoryControlis just a erturn memory (no real memory)

directory port and trassiton and TBE (the email you sent) -- how to set a limit on the number of TBE per directory -- If I set it, it will not cause any runtime issues

disaable MI between GPUs
how the l2 cache in connected per memory or per core(attached to L1)
in MICRO paper, is it one way? i.e. when CPU access, the GPU cache will laso invlaidates
why it takes so long time

gpu-l2-resource-stalls
share with us virtual memory paper

--mem-type=RubyMemoryControl


mme-channels = play around memory numbers
increase the directory => show the tracing
